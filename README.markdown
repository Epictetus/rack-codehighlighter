# Rack::Codehighlighter middleware

*Rack::Codehighlighter* provides a thin wrapper over 
a bunch of code highlighters to make their usage as generic possible.

* ultraviolet
* coderay
* syntax
* prettify
* censor (a fake highlighter used in example below)

Install the gem with:

    sudo gem install wbzyl-rack-codehighlighter -s http://gems.github.com


The middleware looks for code blocks to be highlighted in HTML produced by
application. For each block found it calls requested highlighter.
Below we ask *coderay* to highlight all `pre` elements:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay, :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/

The middleware uses the *pattern* to learn what language the code block
contains, for example

    <pre>:::ruby
    puts "hello world"
    </pre>

Plain description what the *pattern* says: 
If the element contents begins with three colons, the text following
the colons, up to the end of line, identifies the language. The text
matched by the pattern is removed from the code block before
processing.

The above example could be shortened to:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay

because the default options values are used.

Normalization: 

* Highlighted code is always wrapped with `pre` element
  with attributes appropriate for codehighlighter used.
* Language names are taken from Ultraviolet.


## Using with Rack application

*Rack::Codehighlighter* can be used with any Rack application, for example with
a **Sinatra** application. If your application includes a rackup file or
uses *Rack::Builder* to construct the application pipeline, simply
require and use as follows:

    gem 'coderay' ; require 'coderay'  # get one of supported highlighters 
    gem 'ultraviolet' ; require 'uv'
    gem 'syntax' ; require 'syntax/convertors/html'
           
    gem 'wbzyl-rack-codehighlighter'
    require 'rack/codehighlighter'
     
    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay
    run app

Remember to include in the layout an appropriate stylesheet 
(look into `examples/public/stylesheets` directory 
for sample stylesheets).


## Using with Rails

In order to use include the following in a Rails application
`config/environment.rb` file:

    require 'coderay'  # get one of supported highlighters 
    require 'uv'
    require 'syntax/convertors/html'
      
    require 'rack/codehighlighter'
    
    Rails::Initializer.run do |config|  
      config.gem 'coderay'
      config.gem 'ultraviolet'
      config.gem 'syntax'
      
      config.gem 'wbzyl-rack-codehighlighter'
        
      config.middleware.use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay
    end  

Check the Rack configuration:

    rake middleware

Remember to include in the layout an appropriate stylesheet 
(look into `examples/public/stylesheets` directory 
for sample stylesheets).


## Configuration examples

Coderay:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay,
      :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

Ultraviolet:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :ultraviolet, :theme => "dawn", :lines => false,
      :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

Prettify:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :prettify,
      :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

Syntax:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :syntax,
      :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

Censor:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :censor, :reason => "[[--  ugly code removed  --]]",
      :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

In the above examples, the default value of each option is used.

All highlighters use `pre` element to wrap highlighted code.
In Markdown, Maruku and RDiscount templates code is wrapped with `pre>code`.
To remove an extra nesting the `:markdown` option should be used:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay, :markdown => true,
      :element => "pre>code", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

## A simple example with inline template

    # example.rb

    require 'rubygems'
      
    gem 'sinatra', '>=0.9.0'
    require 'sinatra'

    gem 'wbzyl-rack-codehighlighter', '>=0.2.0'
    require 'rack/codehighlighter'
    
    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :censor, :reason => '[[--difficult code removed--]]'
    
    get "/" do
      erb :hello
    end
    
    __END__
    
    @@ hello
    <h3>Fibonacci numbers in Ruby</h3>
    
    <pre>:::ruby
    def fib(n)
      if n < 2
        1
      else
        fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
      end
    end
    </pre>

Run the above example with:

    ruby example.rb

The results are accessible from `http://localhost:4567`.


## Why I use middleware for syntax highlighting

Currently, almost everything what I write is rendered 
by Ruby on Rails and Sinatra applications.
To improve the readability of the text,
I want the code fragments to be colored.

So extending Rails and Sinatra frameworks with syntax
highlighting seems the best way to go.

The problem is to how to hook up syntax highlighting feature 
into these frameworks. Different solutions for each one
framework are needed. This is the current practice.

With Rack based application we can add to the application pipeline.
One solution suffices.

Look at the current practice. Analyze the top three tools
listed on *The Ruby Toolbox* in category 
[Syntax Highlighting](http://ruby-toolbox.com/categories/syntax_highlighting.html).

[tm_syntax_highlighting](http://github.com/arya/tm_syntax_highlighting/) (plugin):

    code(some_ruby_code, :theme => "twilight", :lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => true)

[harsh](http://carboni.ca/projects/harsh/) (plugin):

    <% harsh :theme => :dawn do %>    |    <% harsh %Q{ some_ruby_code }, :theme => :dawn %>
      some_ruby_code                  |
    <% end %>                         |

[*Ruby tips from me, your idol*](http://www.binarylogic.com/2009/04/19/ruby-tips-from-me-your-idol):
I can not tell you how much time Iâ€™ve wasted trying to add in some
cool feature into rails. I would dig into the rails internals,
override methods, do all kinds of tricky stuff. I thought I was
awesome. A month later rails comes out with some cool new feature, I
update rails and everything explodes.

Conclusion: highlighting via plugins is doomed to explode sooner or later.


*Rack::Codehighlighter* provides a thin wrapper over 
a bunch of code highlighters to make their usage as generic possible.

Uniform/define own..

In each piece of code inserted into html we must change:
`<` to `&lt;`. This is annoying thing.
Each(? prettify, dp-) pure javascript highlighter has this defect.

In pre-Rack applications era possible approaches were:

* gems;  conection to methods responsible for code highlighting
  is obtrusive, i.e. via plugin + additional markup

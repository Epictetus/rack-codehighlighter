# Rack::Codehighlighter middleware


## What?

The *rack-codehighlighter* gem provides a thin wrapper over 
a bunch of code highlighters to make their usage as generic possible:

* ultraviolet
* coderay
* syntax
* prettify
* censor (a fake highlighter used in the example below)


## How it works?

*Rack::Codehighlighter* looks for code blocks to be highlighted in the HTML
produced by your application. For each block found it calls requested
highlighter.


## Installing and Usage

Install the gem with:

    sudo gem install wbzyl-rack-codehighlighter -s http://gems.github.com

### Using *rack-codehighlighter* with a Rails application

In order to use, include the following code in a Rails application
`config/environment.rb` file:

    require 'coderay'               # get one of supported highlighters 
    require 'rack/codehighlighter'
    
    Rails::Initializer.run do |config|  
      config.gem 'coderay'
      config.gem 'wbzyl-rack-codehighlighter'
        
      config.middleware.use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay
    end  

### Using *rack-codehighlighter* with a Rack application

The *rack-codehighlighter* gem can be used with any Rack application,
for example with a **Sinatra** application. If your application
includes a rackup file or uses *Rack::Builder* to construct the
application pipeline, simply require and use as follows:

    gem 'coderay'       # get one of supported highlighters 
    require 'coderay'   
           
    gem 'wbzyl-rack-codehighlighter'
    require 'rack/codehighlighter'
     
    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay
    run app


## *Rack::Codehighlighter* by an example

Below we ask *Rack::Codehighlighter* to look for code blocks into all
`pre` *element*s:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay, :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/

and use the `/\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/` *pattern* to learn what language 
the code block contains. 

For example:

    <pre>:::ruby
    puts "hello world"
    </pre>

Informal description of the *pattern*: if the element contents begins
with three colons, the text following the colons, up to the end of
line, identifies the language.
Language names are taken from the *ultraviolet* gem,
see bellow for the list.

Next, the text matched by the pattern is removed from the code block,
the matched element is removed, and code block is passed to *coderay*
highlighter for processing. 

Finally, the highlighted code returned by the *coderay* highlighter is
wrapped with `pre` element with attributes appropriate for the
codehighlighter used.

### More examples

In examples displayed below, the default value of each option is used.

Coderay:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay,
      :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

Ultraviolet:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :ultraviolet, :theme => "dawn", :lines => false,
      :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

Prettify:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :prettify,
      :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

Syntax:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :syntax,
      :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

Censor:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :censor, :reason => "[[--  ugly code removed  --]]",
      :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false


In Markdown, Maruku and RDiscount templates, code is wrapped with `pre>code`.
To remove extra one level of nesting the `:markdown` option should be used:

    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay, :markdown => true,
      :element => "pre>code", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/, :logging => false

Check the `examples` directory for working examples.

## Try it!

Simple Copy & Paste example. Implemented in Sinatra and uses inline template.

    # example.rb

    require 'rubygems'
    gem 'sinatra', '>=0.9.0' 
    require 'sinatra'
    gem 'wbzyl-rack-codehighlighter', '>=0.2.0'
    require 'rack/codehighlighter'
    
    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :censor, :reason => '[[--difficult code removed--]]'
    
    get "/" do
      erb :hello
    end
    
    __END__
    @@ hello
    <h3>Fibonacci numbers in Ruby</h3>
    <pre>:::ruby
    def fib(n)
      if n < 2
        1
      else
        fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
      end
    end
    </pre>

Run the example with:

    ruby example.rb

The results are accessible from `http://localhost:4567`.

## Why? TODO

Currently, almost everything what I write is rendered by Ruby on Rails
and Sinatra applications. To improve the readability of the text, I
want the code fragments to be colored. So extending Rails and Sinatra
frameworks with syntax highlighting is a must.

The problem is to how syntax highlighting features are hooked into
these frameworks.

Look at the current practice. To this end, analyze the top three tools
listed on *The Ruby Toolbox* in category 
[Syntax Highlighting](http://ruby-toolbox.com/categories/syntax_highlighting.html).

[tm_syntax_highlighting](http://github.com/arya/tm_syntax_highlighting/) (plugin):

    code(some_ruby_code, :theme => "twilight", :lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => true)

[harsh](http://carboni.ca/projects/harsh/) (plugin):

    <% harsh :theme => :dawn do %>    |    <% harsh %Q{ some_ruby_code }, :theme => :dawn %>
      some_ruby_code                  |
    <% end %>                         |

[Redcloth with CodeRay](http://github.com/augustl/redcloth-with-coderay) (gem):

    <source:ruby> some_ruby_code </source> 

Overdone: highlighting engine/library/framework.
Different solutions for each one framework are needed.
Different output: include.

With Rack based application we can simplifiy thingst by adding to the
application pipeline..

[*Ruby tips from me, your idol*](http://www.binarylogic.com/2009/04/19/ruby-tips-from-me-your-idol):
I can not tell you how much time Iâ€™ve wasted trying to add in some
cool feature into rails. I would dig into the rails internals,
override methods, do all kinds of tricky stuff. I thought I was
awesome. A month later rails comes out with some cool new feature, I
update rails and everything explodes.

Conclusion: highlighting via plugins is doomed to explode sooner or later.


*Rack::Codehighlighter* provides a thin wrapper over 
a bunch of code highlighters to make their usage as generic possible.

Uniform/define own..

In each piece of code inserted into html we must change:
`<` to `&lt;`. This is annoying thing.
Each(? prettify, dp-) pure javascript highlighter has this defect.

In pre-Rack applications era possible approaches were:

* gems;  connection to methods responsible for code highlighting
  is obtrusive, i.e. via plugin + additional markup

About

The *rack-codehighlighter* allows for easy connecting to and switching
between code highlighters.


Usage

For example, to colorize code with well known *coderay* highlighter use
the following:

    require 'coderay'
    use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay, :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/

From now, HTML pages produced by your application will be
searched by *Rack::Codehighlighter* for code blocks to be highlighted. 

For each found *pre* element, the pattern /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/ 
will be used to extract the language name. For example, 
from the *pre* element below the *ruby* name will be extracted:

    <pre>:::ruby
    printf "hello world"
    </pre>

The code below implements the most popular Ruby code highlighters:
*coderay*, *syntax* and *ultraviolet*.

About

The *rack-codehighlighter* eases the pain with 
connecting to and switching between code higlighters.
The code below implements: *Coderay*, *Syntax* and *Ultraviolet*. 
Other higlighters could be easily added.

Usage

Install the *wbzyl-rack-codehighlighter* gem from the *http://github.com*,
add *Rack::Codehighlighter* to application pipeline, install one of provided
stylesheets, require and use. 

For example, in a Rails application, open *config/environment.rb* file
and add the following code:

    require 'coderay'               # get one of supported highlighters 
    require 'rack/codehighlighter'
    
    Rails::Initializer.run do |config|  
      config.gem 'coderay'
      config.gem 'wbzyl-rack-codehighlighter'
      
      config.middleware.use Rack::Codehighlighter, :coderay, :element => "pre", :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/
    end  

From now, *Rack::Codehighlighter* looks for code blocks to be
highlighted in the HTML produced by your application. 

It calls *Coderay* highlighter for each *pre* element it finds and
and use the /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/ pattern to learn what language the code block contains.
For example, in the code below we tell *coderay* to use *Ruby*:

    <pre>:::ruby
    printf "hello world"
    </pre>

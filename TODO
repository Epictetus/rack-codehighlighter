About

The *Rack::Codehighlighter* allows for easy connecting to 
and switching between code highlighters.
It searches HTML pages produced 
by your application for html elements described
by parameter and a name of code highlighter to be used 
is also passed as a parameter.


Usage

For example, to colorize code in *pre* elements with well known
*coderay* highlighter use the following:

    require 'coderay'
    use Rack::Codehighlighter, 
      :coderay, :element => "pre", 
      :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/

The pattern /\A:::(\w+)\s*\n/ will be used to extract the language name
from the element contents. For example, from the *pre* element below 
the *ruby* name will be extracted:

    <pre>:::ruby
    printf "hello world"
    </pre>

The code below implements three most popular Ruby code highlighters:
*coderay*, *syntax* and *ultraviolet*.
